# Online movies platform

### General info

Simple webpage imitating platform with online movies.
At first, you can see home page where you see all available movies.
You can switch between each category or you can use search bar to check if specific movie is here.
After clicking on specific title you will see modal with all information and movie trailer. You can also add there actual movie to favourites.
Not every movie has modal, because everything was written in vanilla JavaScript and to save my time I decided to leave it as it is. Also I saw how many limitations vanilla JS has :)
I've tried also to add responsive and mobile design.

### How to run
